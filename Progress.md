**Accomplishments**

- Navigation  

**ISSUES/FIXES**
- JournalScreen navigation  
This was inevitably fixed with two terminal lines  
npm uninstall react-native-screens @react-navigation/stack  
npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context  

Apparently I had too new of an installation which was causing my issues.
